When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	Na projektih, kjer veš da boš uporabljal več računalnikov,
	ali pa, kjer veš, da je oz. da bo delalo več različnih ljudi skupaj.  

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Ker sem lahko med delom in mi pull povozi moje spremembe.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork is a copy of a repository on a GitHub, Clone is a copy of a repository on your local machine, Branch is a branch.
	I would use a fork, if I want to copy a repository on GitHub-u. I would use a clone, if I want to copy a repository on a local machine.
	I will create branch, if I want to experiment something on a main branch.
